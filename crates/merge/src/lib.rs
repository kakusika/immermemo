//! Three-way merge for `.tmt` notes, at the AST level rather than the text
//! level.
//!
//! A textual `diff3` treats a note as lines. Tomet documents are trees of
//! `@element(args)[content]{data}` nodes, and most real edits touch
//! different nodes -- editing one `{data}` key on a device while another
//! device edits an unrelated block's `[content]` is not a conflict in any
//! meaningful sense, even though the two edits may land on adjacent lines.
//! Diffing the tree instead of the text is what lets those edits merge
//! silently, which is the entire point of doing this instead of shelling
//! out to `git merge-file`.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! [`merge`] walks `base`, `local` and `remote` together, top-down:
//!
//! 1. At each level, align the child sequence of `base` against `local`
//!    and against `remote` with an LCS-style alignment (the same technique
//!    a line-based diff uses, applied to sibling nodes instead of lines).
//!    Alignment is structural -- two nodes are "the same" position if they
//!    are AST-equal, not by any synthetic identity tomet would have to
//!    invent and inject into the user's document.
//! 2. A child unchanged on one side and changed on the other resolves to
//!    the changed side. A child added on only one side is kept. A child
//!    removed on only one side is dropped.
//! 3. A single base block changed on *both* sides recurses via
//!    `merge_one`, into every part of it independently:
//!    - `content: Vec<Block>` (a `Paragraph`'s `Vec<Inline>`, or an
//!      `Element`'s own `[content]`/`children`, both `Vec<Block>`) gets
//!      the same diff3 treatment as step 1; a single-`Text`-per-side
//!      inline conflict (within a `Paragraph`) recurses once more,
//!      character by character (`merge_text`). This is what lets two
//!      edits to different words in the same sentence merge silently.
//!    - `args`/`{data}` (`Element.value`'s `Group`) recurse by key
//!      (`merge_value`/`merge_value_map`): editing two different
//!      keys never conflicts, and a `Value::Map`/`Value::Seq` inside a
//!      value recurses further still. This only narrows a `{data}`
//!      group made of plain `key: value` pairs -- one holding a nested
//!      element (rather than only pairs) isn't narrowed
//!      (`.agents/tasks/merge-tree-diff.md`).
//!    Each part narrows independently; the recursion only gives up on
//!    the *whole* block (step 4) when at least one part's shape itself
//!    differs (e.g. `[content]` present on one side and absent on the
//!    other) rather than merely disagreeing in value.
//! 4. A conflict `merge_one` can't narrow any further is recorded
//!    in-place as one `@conflict` element -- `tomet`'s own `std` element
//!    for exactly this, bare and needing no `@use`. `a`/`b` are
//!    structural names, not "mine"/"theirs": the side that merged the
//!    note has no way to tell a later reader (on another device, or
//!    itself after the app restarts) which one was whose, so the stored
//!    document doesn't claim to know either -- see `immermemo-editor`'s
//!    `conflicts` module for how a mine/theirs *display* label still
//!    gets derived, without being stored. Two roles, depending on where
//!    the conflict sits:
//!    - **As a sequence of blocks/inlines**, `a`/`b` each hold the
//!      disputed stretch's own blocks directly (`Value::Blocks`, `tomet`'s
//!      `key: [...]` value grammar) -- no marker triple, no terminator;
//!      `@conflict`'s own `(args)` is the whole thing. At the
//!      `Document.blocks`/`children`/`content` level this is a block-
//!      placed element; inside a paragraph's inline content, the same
//!      element inline, with `a`/`b` each wrapping their inline run in
//!      one `Paragraph` to fit the same `Vec<Block>` shape.
//!    - **As a single value** (a `{data}` key, or `args`), it becomes
//!      `@conflict(a: ..., b: ...)` sitting where the value went, using
//!      named args rather than `{value}` -- a value slot only permits
//!      `(args)` on an embedded element -- with `a`/`b` as plain scalars
//!      (whatever the disputed value itself was), not `Value::Blocks`.
//!
//! # What this crate assumes
//!
//! A `base` is always available: `immermemo-sync` only calls into this
//! crate for an actual three-way git merge, where `git2` has already found
//! a merge base commit. Linking two vaults that do not share history is a
//! separate operation (vault adoption), not a merge, and is not this
//! crate's problem.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! - [`merge`] (the module, via [`merge()`] the function): the merge half
//!   of the algorithm above.
//! - [`resolve`]: strips markers back out once a side has been picked.
//! - [`find_conflicts`]: reads markers back out without removing them, for
//!   showing the user what's in conflict.
//! - `markers`: the `@conflict` marker shape itself (construction and
//!   detection), shared by all three.
//! - `diff3`: the plain three-way sequence alignment every level of the
//!   tree reuses; has no idea it's being used for an AST.
